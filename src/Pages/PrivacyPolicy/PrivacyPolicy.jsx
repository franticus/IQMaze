          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service will at times place and/or store code or other types of
          information and/or devices (e.g., “cookies”) on your computer, mobile
          or other device(“Local Device Storage”). We may use Local Device
          Storage for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation
          to determine which of our messages have been opened by recipients so
          we can gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, to control the
          display of ads, to track usage patterns, the movements of individual
          users, and your geographic location, to help diagnose problems with
          our servers, to gather broad demographic information, to analyze
          trends, to conduct research, to deliver editorial content, to record
          registration and personalization information, and to otherwise
          administer the Service. For example, if you register on any part of
          the Service and are given the option to save your user name and
          password, we may provide this convenience to you via Local Device
          Storage. Local Device Storage may also collect and store your
          personally identifiable information, which may be shared with our
          parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates and other companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not want Local Device Storage, your computer, mobile or
          other device may include an option that allows you to not accept it.
          However, if you disable Local Device Storage, some portions of the
          Service may not function properly.

          <strong>Additional Rights.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this Section we have summarized the rights that you may have under

          reasonable fee.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you
          rectified and, considering the purposes of the processing, to have any
          incomplete personal data about you completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your

          or defense of legal claims.
        </p>
        <p>

          your personal data. Those circumstances may include you contest the
          accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful, but you oppose
          erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our
          processing, but you require personal data for the establishment,

          processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where
          processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store
          your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with
          your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
          claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
          person; or for reasons of important public interest.

          on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the
          extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing
          is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public
          interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or
          the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
          party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the
          personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate

          freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or
          defense of legal claims.

        <p>

          You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data
          for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes

          reasons of public interest.

          data is:(i) your consent; or (ii) that the processing is necessary for
          the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to
          take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such
          processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to
          receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and
          machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it
          would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
        </p>

          information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at
          any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing
          before the withdrawal.

          If you consider that our processing of your personal information
          infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a
          complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
          protection.{' '}

          You may request that the personal information we hold about you be
          corrected by contacting us. If we do not agree to your request for a
          correction, you may then request that we take reasonable steps to
          attach to the information a statement of the correction sought but not
          made.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that some of these rights may be limited or
          unavailable where we have an overriding interest or legal obligation
          to continue to process the data, or where data may be exempt from
          disclosure.{' '}
