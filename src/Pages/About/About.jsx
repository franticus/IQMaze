        <p className={s.sectionText}>
          Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests are a series of standardized
          assessments that evaluate a range of cognitive skills, such as
          problem-solving, logical reasoning, memory, and general knowledge. The
          scores from these tests are designed to reflect an individual's
          relative intellectual capabilities compared to the population. With a
          legacy dating back over a century, IQ tests have evolved to become a
          valuable tool for educational placement, assessment of intellectual
          disability, and even job candidate evaluation.
